    "description": "I am currently interning at Pfizer for a period of six months. I am working in the BRD downstream modelling team. I am working on two main projects:\n\n1. **GUI Development**: Developing an interactive GUI for laboratory scientists to run ion-exchange chromatography simulations using CADET.\n\n2. **Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)**: Conducting research on modeling Ion Exchange (IEX) and Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) processes using PINNs. Validating model predictions with experimental data, achieving high fidelity in capturing key chromatographic behaviors.",
